**escompose** implements the [ES Components] specification to allow you to define special properties on a hierarchy of reactive objects.

> **escompose** is a core library of [Brains@Play].

## Getting Started
To create a component, pass any object with GraphScript properties to the `create` function:
```js
const esc = {
    __element: 'button',
    __attributes: {
        onclick: function (input) { console.log(this) }
    }
}

const component = escompose.create(esc, {__parent: document.body})
component.__element.click()
```

These objects are deep cloned, meaning that **all properties attached to the object itself are independent across instantiations**.

### Classes
If you prefer to work with classes, these will also be instanced using this function:

```js
class MyButton {
    __element: 'button',
    __attributes: {
        onclick: function (input) { console.log(this) }
    }
}

const component = escompose.create(MyButton, {__parent: document.body})
component.__element.click()
```

However, **class instances are assumed to be sufficiently instanced by the user**. As such, local objects attached to the class itself will be shared across instances.

### Arrays
In specific cases, an array may be useful to apply bulk operations to independent Components:
```js
const components = escompose.create([esc, myButton, esc], {
    __parent: document.body,
    __attributes: {
        onclick: function (input) { console.log(this) }
    }
})
components.forEach(component => component.__element.click())
```

### Linking Components to Source Text
A string can be passed to grab the Component from a local JavaScript file—or, with additional utilities, compile from source text:
```js
import * as esm from 'esmpile'
const esc = './index.esc.js'
const component = escompose.create(esc)
const component = escompose.create(esc, {__parent: document.body},  { utilities: { bundle: esm.bundle.get}})
component.__element.click()
```


### Creating Components from Functions
A function can be passed directly as a Component, which wraps it as the `default` function of a new component:
```js
const esc = (input) => console.log(input)
const component = escompose.create(esc, {__parent: document.body})
component.default()
```

If you're looking to listen to a function, you can simply add it as a property _inside_ a valid ES Component object.

### Applying Components to DOM Element
Elements can be passed to apply Components to existing DOM elements:
```js
const esc = document.querySelector('button')
const component = escompose.create(esc, {
    __attributes: {
        onclick: function (input) { console.log(this) }
    }
})
component.__element.click()
```

## GraphScript Properties
GraphScript properties refer to **special properties that are used to instantiate the Component**. These properties are prefixed with `__` and are recognized with **loaders** than can be used to experiment with new Component behaviors

> See the [ES Components] specification for a full list of default properties. 

All ES Components have at least one GraphScript property at instantiation. All other properties throughout an ES Component are listeneable by the root Component.

> **Note:** This includes classes and functions. Classes will not be instantiated without a static `__` property. On the other hand, functions will not converted to a `default` property without a `__` property set—though they will still be listenable without it.

Active components are recognized by the presence of the `__` property on them. This provides access to utilities such as `run` and `subscribe`—as well as retains a record of read-only properties maintained by the library itself.

All other `__` properties are considered GraphScript properties, and are used to program the behavior of the Component. 

## Component Instancing
Components are created using the `create` factory function, which accepts any object (e.g. Object, Array, or Class) and outputs an analogous object.

**Unlike graphscript, we do not return a standard class from the `create` function.** Instead, the Component is returned based on the type of the input object.

### Objects
Objects are extensively instanced and treated as templates. This means that **all properties attached to the object itself are independent across instantiations**. 

### Classes
Classes are instanced using the `new` keyword. The resulting instancing behavior is assumed to be appropriate for the Component. This allows for minimal performance overhead when using classes.

### Arrays
Arrays are iterated over and each item is passed to the factory function. The resulting array is returned.

## Loaders
Additional properties can be added using the loaders argument for escompose: 
```js
const component = escompose.create(esc, {__parent: document.body}, {
    loaders: [ myLoader ]
})
```

## Listeners
ES Component listeners are implemented using the [esmonitor] library, which is a **simple plain-text subscription interface for arbitrary object properties**.
